    },
    "prizes": {
      "question": "How do I win prizes?",
      "answer": "To win prizes, you need to achieve one of the top positions in the competition rankings. Winners are determined based on their percentage return on investment (ROI) at the end of the competition period. The higher your ranking, the bigger your prize!"
